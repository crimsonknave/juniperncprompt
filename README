Install steps (below) are compiled from http://makefile.com/.plan/2009/10/juniper-vpn-64-bit-linux-an-unsolved-mystery/

This script logs into a juniper network connect vpn website using authentication provided by you and retrieves the DSID cookie which can be passed to the ncui executable to create a VPN tunnel.  This allows users on linux to connect to the tunnel without using the web client and/or a 32 bit java.

I found it neccessary to use this solution because my work required both a password and a secureid token and all of the tools provided by Juniper do not allow you to pass a second password.  If you only need to use a single password the accepted answer seems to be to use http://mad-scientist.us/juniper.html, but my script should work as well (Haven't tested it, but see no reason it won't)

What you need to get this to work:
1) xterm (the java app won't install the files without xterm)
2) gcc multilib (I've only tested this on 64 bit)
3) /tmp and /etc on the same partition (the program can't swap your
/etc/resolv.conf otherwise... sad, I know)
4) python (I believe 2.7 is needed, not sure it might run on 2.6 and it is almost python 3
compatable, should be only library names needing to be changed.

To get the files we'll need do the following:
1) Log in to your vpn website
2) If you aren't redirected to the network connect page go there
3) A java app should try to start let it run (you will likely be asked twice)
4) Make sure that you have libncui.so and ncsvc in ~/.juniper_networks/network_connect/
5) If you don't have both of those make sure xterm is installed and that a java prompt didn't get hidden under a window

Setup the files:
1) cd ~/.juniper_networks/network_connect
2) gcc -m32 -Wl,-rpath,`pwd` -o ncui libncui.so
3) sudo chown root:root ncui
4) sudo chmod 4775 ncui
5) echo | openssl s_client -connect vpn.constantcontact.com:443 2>&1 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' | openssl x509 -outform der > ssl.crt
6) cd elementtidy-1.0-20050212 
7) sudo python setup.py (make sure you use the correct version of python to setup and install if you have multiple versions on your system)
8) cd ../
9) ./juniperncprompt.py vpn.website
10) ifconfig (typically /sbin for those who don't have sbin in their path)
You should see a tun0, if so everything worked and you are connected to the vpn

The default values are set up for the vpn setup at my work, they can all be adjusted with a command line flag or by changing the source file if you want.
